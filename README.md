# Module-9-Surfs-up

## Project Overview:

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

* Determine Statistical overview of June
* Determine Statistical overview of Dec
* Determine if the Ice Cream shop can stay open year round.

## Summary

* Based off the Chart, December had the higher precipitation of .22 inches while June had .14 inches. The Inverse is True for their Temperature's of 75°F for June is higher than the mean temperature of 71°F for December.
* Based off the table There is little fluctuation for Maximum temp. 85°F  for december and 83°F  for june. For a Ice Cream store, they should be able to sell Year round as its always hot.plus the Average temp between june and dec is around 71-75°F. There is little change to no change on a day to day basis. 
* The amount of precipitation is higher in dec with 0.22 inches. June only experienced 0.14 inches. 


W.Avy's Ice cream store should be open on all days of the year, its always hot in hawaii as the maximum temp is always above 80°F. There is also a very tiny amount of precipitation Avy should not have to worry about rain causing much closure to her store. Precipitation is higher in December so June would be a more profitable as a result of lower days closed. I think Avy should keep the ice cream store open 365 days of the year. In exception to a random heavy rain day which is unlikely.
